        Rust has been steadily gaining momentum in the industry since its first stable release in 2015. Here's a closer look at the key trends shaping Rust adoption in 2025.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-display mt-8">Enterprise Adoption</h3>
      
      <p class="font-body">Major tech companies are increasingly adopting Rust for critical infrastructure:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 font-body">
        <li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Using Rust for parts of Windows, Azure, and security-critical components</li>
        <li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Deployed Rust in performance-sensitive services and AWS infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Google</strong>: Implementing Rust in Android, Chrome, and Fuchsia OS</li>
        <li><strong>Meta</strong>: Migrating C++ codebase to Rust for improved reliability and performance</li>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>: Deploying Rust for edge computing and high-performance services</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-body">The adoption by these tech giants signals Rust's readiness for enterprise-scale deployment and creates a flywheel effect for broader industry adoption.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-display mt-8">WebAssembly and Web Development</h3>
      
      <p class="font-body">Rust has emerged as the leading language for WebAssembly (Wasm) development:</p>
      
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 font-body">
        <li><strong>Performance-critical web applications</strong>: Companies use Rust+Wasm to bring near-native performance to web applications</li>
        <li><strong>Edge computing</strong>: Cloudflare Workers and other edge platforms support Rust for distributed computing</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming</strong>: Web-based games leverage Rust's performance and safety guarantees</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-platform development</strong>: Rust code compiled to Wasm can run across browsers, servers, and IoT devices</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p class="font-body">According to the WebAssembly Survey 2024, Rust is the primary language used for 68% of production WebAssembly applications.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-display mt-8">Embedded Systems and IoT</h3>
      
      <p class="font-body">Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety make it ideal for resource-constrained environments:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 font-body">
        <li>Embedded Rust ecosystem has matured with better HAL support for major microcontrollers</li>
        <li>Real-time capabilities improved with predictable performance guarantees</li>
        <li>Safety certification processes established for critical embedded systems</li>
        <li>Growing adoption in automotive, aerospace, and medical device industries</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-body">The ability to write safe, low-level code without garbage collection makes Rust particularly attractive for IoT devices where reliability is critical.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-display mt-8">Job Market Growth</h3>
      
      <p class="font-body">The demand for Rust developers continues to outpace supply:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 font-body">
        <li><strong>Salary premium</strong>: Rust developers command 15-25% higher salaries compared to similar roles</li>
        <li><strong>Remote opportunities</strong>: 78% of Rust positions offer remote work options</li>
        <li><strong>Startup adoption</strong>: 42% of tech startups founded in 2024 use Rust in their stack</li>
        <li><strong>Industry diversity</strong>: Beyond tech, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors are recruiting Rust developers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-body">Stack Overflow's Developer Survey has ranked Rust as the "most loved language" for eight consecutive years, showing sustained developer enthusiasm.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold font-display mt-8">Security-Critical Applications</h3>
      
      <p class="font-body">Memory safety issues remain the root cause of approximately 70% of security vulnerabilities in C/C++ codebases. Organizations are turning to Rust to address these concerns:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 font-body">
        <li><strong>Critical infrastructure</strong>: Power grids, telecommunications, and water systems</li>
        <li><strong>Financial services</strong>: Trading systems, payment processing, and blockchain</li>
        <li><strong>Aerospace and defense</strong>: Avionics, satellite systems, and secure communications</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Medical devices and patient data systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="font-body">The US government's cybersecurity agencies have officially recommended Rust for new systems development, further accelerating adoption in regulated industries.</p>
